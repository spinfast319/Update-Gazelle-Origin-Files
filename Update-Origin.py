# Update Gazelle-Origin Files
# author: hypermodified
# version: 1.0
# This script is meant to use the exisitng yaml origin files and update them with the more complete origin+ files
# It takes the folder and opens the yaml to get the url. It then uses the url to run origin query and names the file something differnt.
# It then deletes the original origin and renames the new one to origin.
# It can handle albums with artwork folders or multiple disc folders in them. It can also handle specials characters and removes any characters that makes windows fail.
# You need gazelle-origin installled for it to work.

# ToDo
# check to see if folder name has special characters, if  so log it 
# move the updated folders to a done folder...that way you will have a nice folder of the ones that need to be run manaully
# Add error handling for if the gazzele link is missing (write to log)
# test in linux
# see if i can move the trailing slashes to the directory variable
